# Backend Perpus - Library Management System API

A RESTful API for managing a library system built with Express.js, Sequelize ORM, and MySQL.

## üìö Description

This project is a backend application for managing a library system. It provides APIs for user authentication, book management, borrowing operations, and user management. The system is designed to help libraries track their book inventory and user borrowing history efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web application framework
- **Sequelize** - ORM for database interactions
- **MySQL** - Relational database
- **JWT** - Authentication and authorization
- **Bcrypt** - Password hashing
- **Multer** - File uploading middleware

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hadi-rch/backend-perpus.git
   cd backend-perpus/final-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```
   Create a .env file with the following variables:
   DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   DB_HOST=localhost
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:create
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all   # Optional for development data
   ```
